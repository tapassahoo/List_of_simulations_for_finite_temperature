# ListOfSimulationsForFiniteTemperature

# List of simulations has been performed for the estimation of thermodynamic properties at a finite temperature for many linear rotors systems

List of simulations by using Path Integral Monte Carlo for the estimation of thermodynamic properties of N number of rotors placed in a linear chain.  The following parameters has been used for all simulations -
 ```
Rotational B constant = 20.561 wavenumber
R    = 10.05 Angstrom
		
# of Blocks = 150000
# of Pass   = 200
